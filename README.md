## 3. Use in Docker

If needed (eg. due to build/install problems on MacOS), a Docker-based version can also be built and started. 

This version uses an interactive Python environment called Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/).

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- Install Docker (see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Install any web browser.

### 3.2 Build and start notebook

Execute the following commands:

```
docker build . --tag questgen-ai:latest
docker run -p 8888:8888 questgen-ai:latest
```

The notebook command that is run by `docker run` in the background eventually shall print its URL to the output:
```$ docker run -p 8888:8888 hackweek:latest
[I 08:33:50.908 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret
[I 08:33:51.078 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /src/jupyter
[I 08:33:51.078 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8 is running at:
[I 08:33:51.079 NotebookApp] http://e4a08a830f4e:8888/?token=c7eec1eafcf292f1595f3786f3de5dd15080d9fd277da5b0
[I 08:33:51.079 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=c7eec1eafcf292f1595f3786f3de5dd15080d9fd277da5b0
[I 08:33:51.079 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 08:33:51.082 NotebookApp]

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-7-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://e4a08a830f4e:8888/?token=c7eec1eafcf292f1595f3786f3de5dd15080d9fd277da5b0
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=c7eec1eafcf292f1595f3786f3de5dd15080d9fd277da5b0
```

Do not exit from this command.  Copy and paste the URL starting with `127.0.0.1` to the browser to login to Jupyter. 
By opening a new notebook the code examples above shall work.

### NLP models used

For maintaining meaningfulness in Questions, Questgen uses Three T5 models. One for Boolean Question generation, one for MCQs, FAQs, Paraphrasing and one for answer generation.
